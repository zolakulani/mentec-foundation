## Requirements

### Core Features
1. Collect user input via `prompt()` for:
   - Age (number)
   - Favorite color (string)

2. Implement conditional logic that:
   - Alerts "Teen Blue Fan!" if age is 13-19 and color is "blue"
   - Alerts "Young Artist" if under 13 and color is not "black"
   - Alerts "Welcome, Adult!" if over 19

3. Display results using:
   - `alert()` for immediate feedback
   - `document.write()` with CSS styling

### Stretch Features
